Player will start each level with four characters, one for each class: (fighter, wizard, etc.)

The tomb is randomly generated and starts out with all squares hidden. As the player moves the characters around 
more of the tomb will be revealed. The object is to find 3 keys which when picked up by the characters
will complete the level (and send the characters to the next level).

Each character will have unique attributes:
- how far it can move
- what squares it will reveal
- how it deals with enemies
