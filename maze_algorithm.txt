This will be done in 2 steps, step 1 to generate the map via Kruskal's algorithm, and step 1 to expand the map.  This is due to the fact that the finished maze will have walls that are 1 cell in width (rather than 0-width walls between cells). Any maze algorithm could be substituted into part 1.

Part 1  (Kruskal's algorithm)
1. Create a set of all the (internal) edges in the grid.
2. Randomly pick an edge. If the edge connects two cells that are not
   already connected, connect those cells (i.e. those cells' networks).
   If the cells are already connected, throw the edge away.
3. Repeat until no edges are left.

Part 2
Insert a row between each row created in part 1, and a column
between each column  created in part 1.

1. Create a new grid of dimensions (2w + 1) x (2h + 1)
   to get from the new cell coordinates to the original:
      x1 = (x2 - 1) / 2
      y1 = (y2 - 1) / 2
2. (First Pass) For each new cell:
   All new cells have even indices.  
   if x == 0 or x == 2m or y == 0 or y == 2n:
      the cell is a wall (the outer border)
   if x is odd and y is odd:
      the cell is one of the original mazes open cells and is thus always open
   if x is odd and y is even:
      check the connection of the original cells above and below:
      i.e. ((y2 - 1) - 1) / 2  (above) = (y2 - 2) / 2
            ((y2 + 1) -1 ) / 2 (below) = y2/2 
      if they are not connected, this is a wall
   if x is even and y is odd:
      check the connection of the original cells right and left:
      i.e. ((x2 - 1) - 1) / 2  (above) = (x2 - 2) / 2
            ((x2 + 1) -1 ) / 2 (below) = x2/2 
      i they are not connected, this is a wall      
   if x is even and y is even:
      mark as undecided -- will complete in second pass
  
3. (Second Pass) For each undecided cell:
   If any of the neighboring (right, left, up, down) cells is a wall, set
   this cell to be a wall
